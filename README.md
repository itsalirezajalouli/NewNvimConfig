# My New Nvim Config
okay i was very upset that my config was getting so slow and bloated.
i literally couldn't even handle simple lsp stuff in less than one second and 
honestly we use neovim for speed so i made a new one from scratch.

## Cool stuff:
- Simple key-bindings:
    - use space + e to explore files
    - use shift + j and k to move lines
    - use shift + j and k to move lines
    - use shift + e to show errors in current line
    - use shift + k to show the docs for the function you're on
    - use gd for going to the defintion 
    - use space + ca for code actions when you have skill issues!
    - use space + ra to rename the current variable you're on
    - use space + rr to get all the references
- Harpoon for jumping around the files:
    - use space + a to add, space + m for menu and space + number to go the file you need
- Fuzzy finder:
    - use space + pf for searching in project, space + ps to search for a word in project and space + gs for git stuff
