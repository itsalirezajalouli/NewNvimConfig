# My New Nvim Config
okay i was very upset that my config was getting so slow and bloated.
i literally couldn't even handle simple lsp stuff in less than one second and 
honestly we use neovim for speed so i made a new one from scratch.

## Cool stuff:
- Simple key-bindings:
    - space + e: to explore files
    - space + t: opens terminal in command bar for 1 command
    - shift + j: and k to move lines
    - shift + j: and k to move lines
    - shift + e: to show errors in current line
    - shift + k: to show the docs for the function you're on
    - gd: for going to the defintion 
    - space + ca: for code actions when you have skill issues!
    - space + ra: to rename the current variable you're on
    - space + rr: to get all the references
- Harpoon for jumping around the files:
    - space + a: to add
    - space + m: for menu
    - space + number: to go the file you need
- Fuzzy finder:
    - space + f: searching a file name in project
    - space + ff: to search for a word in project
    - space + fg: search through git
- Fugitive:
    - space + gg: for git stuff
